Changes from version 4.0.2 to version 4.0.3
===========================================

- Changed 'id' for each generated enum value to be the same as its 'name'. This is to allow backward compatibility in persisted enum values (in workflows) from this release forward
- Added generation of getter methods in generated enum classes to expose their (enum) values. As a result of this change, enum values are now accessible through (JavaScript) scripting code and are also visible in vRO's API documentation

===========================================

- Added logic to generated "Add" workflow scripting blocks to prevent fields that have no values specified (i.e. empty string) to be persisted in VSD.
- Added logic to generated "Edit" workflow scripting blocks to allow fields whose values have been removed (i.e. empty string) to be persisted as empty strings in VSD.
- Assigned version number to actions and workflows to fix plug-in upgrade issue.
